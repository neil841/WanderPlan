## 💡 Recommendations for Usage

### Optimal Workflow

```bash
# 1. Read documentation first (30 min investment)
cat GETTING-STARTED.md
cat BEST-PRACTICES.md

# 2. Initialize project with care
/start-project  # Take time to answer well

# 3. Let Phase 0 complete fully
/orchestrate  # Product strategy (review carefully!)
/orchestrate  # API design
/orchestrate  # Database design
/orchestrate  # System architecture (validate everything!)

# 4. Use autonomous mode for implementation
/auto-phase  # Let it run overnight if needed

# 5. Monitor progress in separate terminal
watch -n 60 '/status'

# 6. Handle blockers immediately
/show-blockers  # Check regularly
/fix-blockers   # Resolve quickly

# 7. Use enhancement agents before production
/orchestrate  # security-agent (CRITICAL)
/orchestrate  # performance-monitoring-agent
/orchestrate  # technical-documentation-agent

# 8. Deploy with confidence
git push  # CI/CD takes over
```
